    <strong>Read these instructions carefully.</strong>
    You are about to connect your ROBLOX and Gmail accounts. By doing so:
    <ul>
      <li>You once again confirm that you have read and understood the <a href="https://pathos-cria.github.io/database/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> and the <a href="https://pathos-cria.github.io/database/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li>To this point, your Google Account was stored merely for a few hours in the cache for session continuity. By verifying your account, you are essentially registering an account with this App, allowing us to store the details of your Gmail address and ROBLOX ID and their respective connection. This is further explained in the Privacy Policy.</li>
      <li>You confirm that you are the sole owner and controller of the Gmail and ROBLOX accounts. You agree not to allow any other person to access these accounts. You agree to take reasonable security measures provided by the respective platforms to protect these accounts.</li>
      <li>You confirm that this is not your real, personal email address. You are strongly encouraged to create a separate email address for ROBLOX purposes if you haven't already, and you accept the risks associated with not doing so.</li>
      <li>Lastly, you confirm that you have been authorized by the App operator to register or are a member of at least one of the following groups of individuals:<ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/4606666" target="_blank">Daxrentha's Security Department</a></li>
